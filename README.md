# üçò Arancina is the only way üçò
[![Coverage Status][coverall-svg]][coverall-io]

This Chrome extension is thinked after a crazy night.
I'm a developer born in Palermo in Sicily and in my land we protect with really passion the word Arancina.
Maybe there isn't really a reason to hate other inflections of this word
but there is something inside me that hurts when I hear this crippled word.

This pain also expanded during reading over time
So if you are wondering why this extension exists I think it is not for you
This extension help all people that, like me, need to resolves this pain.
Enjoy, install and spread with the hope that this word will be corrected

*Content* contains all messages listerer. This file is the unique that can comunicate and see the user DOM.
*Background* control the interaction event of user with chrome tab and send messages that was listened to content.ts to trigger specific functionality.

#### Communication from pages
Each file doesn't know what the other does. All logics are connected to`chrome.tabs.sendMessage`.
A message is an action that have an instruction for specific area. It is composed from a type(*required*) and a payload
