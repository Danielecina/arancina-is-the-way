# üçò Arancina is the only way üçò
[![Coverage Status][coverall-svg]][coverall-io]

This Chrome extension was born after a crazy night.
I'm a developer from Palermo, Sicily and in my land we protect with strong passion the word Arancina.
Maybe there isn't really a reason to hate other inflections of this word
but there is something inside me that hurts when I hear it crippled.

This pain also expanded while reading over time
So if you are wondering why this extension exists, I think it is not for you
This extension help all people that, like me, need to resolve this pain.
Enjoy, install it and spread it with the hope that this word will be corrected all over the world!

## üè¢ Architecture

#### Manifest.json
Manifest.json is the most important part of application configuration.
This file contains the Chrome configuration. You can [see more info here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/)

#### Pages
*Popup* contains the React app code.
*Content* contains all messages listeners. This file is the only that can communicate with and access the user DOM.
*Background* controls the interaction events of users with Chrome tab and send messages to content.ts to trigger specific functionality.

#### Communication from pages
Each file doesn't know what the others do. All logics are connected to `chrome.tabs.sendMessage`.
A message is an action that have an instruction for specific area. It is composed by a type(*required*) and a payload
